#' Send an R object by email
#'
#' This function sends an R object by email in the form of an RDS object. Email
#' address can be specified explicitly or defined by a pseudo from the addresses
#' book (see function \code{addresses} for managing the addresses book). To be
#' able to use this functionn the user needs to do some configuration first that
#' include:
#'
#' 1. we recommand the user creates a gmail email account that will be used
#' exclusively by the \code{send} function. It's safer in terms of security than
#' using the user's normal email account.
#'
#' 2. if you are using Mac OS X, configure your system following the steps from
#' here \url
#'
#' @seealso The function \code{addresses} allows to manage the addresses book and
#' see the pseudo that can be used in the \code{send} function in place of a
#' fully defined email address.
#'
#' @param x A vector of characters.
#' @return The translation of x in Basic Latin.

# This is how we need to configure the system:
# (1) create a gmail email account
# (2) http://www.developerfiles.com/how-to-send-emails-from-localhost-mac-os-x-el-capitan/
# Note: you'll need to change the security parameters of your email account
# Note: you may want to forward all the email of your new account towards another one.
# Note: you may want to define the export REPLYTO=mchoisy@gmail.com is your .bashrc file.
